→ Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations

The key tricks for the SIMPLE algorithm are to :
    → Derive an equation for pressure from the momentum and continuity equations.
    → Derive a corrector for the velocity field, so that it satisfies the continuity equation.

Solution process :
    1.  Solve the momentum equation for the velocity field. This velocity field does not satisfy the continuity equation.
        → MU = -∇p
        → H = AU - MU

    2.  Solve the Poisson equation for the pressure field.
        → ∇·(A⁻¹∇p) = ∇(A⁻¹H)

    3.  Use the pressure field to correct the velocity field so that is satisfies the continuity equation.
        → U = A⁻¹H - A⁻¹∇p
        
    4.  The velocity field now does not satisfy the momentum equations. So repeat the cycle.
